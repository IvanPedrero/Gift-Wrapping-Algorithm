# Gift Wrapping Algorithm

Gift wrapping algorithm implementation using javascript and its p5.js library.

The code is based on the program by The Coding Train (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNyULRrydVI) with modifications to make it more interactive. The program accepts user input to create the points in the space and to create the hull.

# How it works?

Click on the black screen to create points in the canvas. Once you have a set of points, click on the buton to create the convex hull with them. You can see how the algorithm chooses between the points to build the hull. 

Once finished, click again on the button to reset the canva and create a new set of points.
